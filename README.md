## ðŸ“– About The Project

This repository contains my personal solutions to the bioinformatics programming challenges on the Rosalind platform. The primary goal is to provide **clear, well-documented, and robust solutions** that are both easy to understand and verify.

Each solution is:
* **Reproducible**: Scripts are designed to work consistently with specified dependencies.
* **Tested**: Unit tests are included to ensure correctness against sample datasets.
* **Documented**: Code includes comments and explanations of the underlying bioinformatics concepts.

This project serves as a personal learning log and a reference for others tackling these fascinating problems.
