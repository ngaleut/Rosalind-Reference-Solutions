## Why this repo?

Rosalind (rosalind.info) is an excellent way to learn algorithms through problems grounded in computational biology. This repository aims to provide:

- **Readable** solutions that prioritize clarity over clever one-liners.  
- **Reproducibility** with deterministic I/O, pinned dependencies (when used), and seeds for RNG.  
- **Correctness** via unit tests and property/snapshot tests where appropriate.  
- **Teaching value** through docstrings, references, complexity notes, and links back to the original problems.

> ⚖️ **Academic Integrity**  
> These implementations are for learning, benchmarking, and verification. If you’re taking a class that assigns Rosalind problems, follow your course’s collaboration and honor code policies. Don’t submit these solutions as your own work.
